        <p id="project1_text">
          This website was a project for the course IT2805 that i took during
          autumn 2022. The website was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The
          project was made for a fictional raninforest-preservation client.
          During the project I worked with 5 other students, which also gave
          insight to using different Git functionality such as branching,
          pulling, pushing and solving merge conflicts.

        <p id="oop-text">
          In the spring of my first year I had a course in object-oriented
          programming in Java. In the course we had to make a project using
          JavaFX either in groups of 2 or alone. Me and a friend made a project
          around booking and cancelling flights. Where we made a really simple
          backend that generated some random flights and had logic for booking
          flights, writing them to files and reading these files.
